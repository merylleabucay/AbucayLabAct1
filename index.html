        <p>By myself sometimes <br>
            To give my mind some space <br>
            Yeah, I know, yeah, I know that it hurts <br>
            When I push your love away, I hate myself <br>
            I wanna tell you lies <br>
            So your heart won't break <br>
             Yeah, I know, yeah, I know that <br> 
             I made my fair share of mistakes <br>
